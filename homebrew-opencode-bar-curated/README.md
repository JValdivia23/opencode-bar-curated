Homebrew Tap: JValdivia23/homebrew-opencode-bar-curated

This repository contains a Homebrew Cask for the curated OpenCode Bar distribution.

Usage (after tap is created and cask updated with the real SHA256):

  brew tap JValdivia23/opencode-bar-curated
  brew install --cask opencode-bar-curated

Notes:
- The cask uses a placeholder SHA256 (`PLACEHOLDER_SHA256`). Replace it with the DMG SHA256 from GitHub release v1.0.0 before publishing.
- The URL points to the GitHub release asset: `OpenCodeBar-1.0.0.dmg`.
